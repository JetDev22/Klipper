## Intro
***
When my Anycubic Mega S started making problems I decided to take it apart and save the parts for a later project.
The first reincarnation was the Printer X1 project, using 3030 Frame parts, SKR 2.0 as board and run it with Marlin 2.X as firmware.

It worked but not really as expected. I think it came down to my poor Marlin firmware, that I wrote from scratch.
I kept reading articles about Klipper and saw some great YouTube videos about Klipper and made the decision to take the parts I have and create another printer, this time using klipper.
